# Number-Storage
This is a personal project of mine created for a client. This project allows a user to enter 2 numbers which are stored in a text file for future use.
when the program is run again, the system retrieves the 2 previously numbers entered and performs a calculation on the 2 numbers alongside 2 new numbers entered by the user.
the 2 new number then replace the original 2 numbers to be retrieved for use the next time the program is run.
each time the program is run, a second text file is also created to log all the numbers used in every transaction.
